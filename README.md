## Description

My motiviation for completing this project was the desire to master a new craft. It is my mission to become an elite programmer and to build my own apps. I worked on this project to get a baseline understanding of the 6-month bootcamp I was walking into, and how I can best achieve my goals. I was able to benchmark my current skills against what the class would be asking for. I learned a lot about how to use VS Code, GitHub, and that there is a lot more to coding than just learning languages.
